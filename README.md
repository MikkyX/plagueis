# The tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"
This is just a little something I cooked up for fun to hide in my projects from time to time. This simple JavaScript file replays the conversation between Emperor Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker from Episode III. You know, [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05dT34hGRdg)...

Just download it, include it in your project, and watch the console.log as the story is retold via the medium of JavaScript. The timings aren't precise, but they're not far off.
