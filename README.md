# The tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"
This is just a little something I cooked up for fun to hide in my projects from time to time. This simple JavaScript file replays the conversation between Emperor Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker from Episode III. You know, [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05dT34hGRdg)...

## Usage
Just download it, include it in your project, and watch the console.log as the story is retold via the medium of JavaScript. The timings aren't precise, but they're not far off.

Please [drop me a tweet](https://twitter.com/mikkyx) and let me know if you're using it!

## Contributing
If you want to firm up the timings a little bit, or tidy up the code (this literally took me about 20 minutes and I have NO idea how browser-supported it is), feel free to submit a pull request.
